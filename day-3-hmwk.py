# What is a class?

print('''A class is a code template for creating objects.\n This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class. \n\n''')

# What is an instance of a class?

print('An object is an instance of a class.   '
      'Instance = class(arguments)\n\n')

# What is a method for a class instance

print('''Methods are simply another kind of function that reside in classes. \nYou create and work with methods in Python in precisely the same way that you do functions,\n except that methods are always associated with a class. You can create two kinds of methods: those associated with the class itself and those associated with an instance of a class. \nIt’s important to differentiate between the two.\n\n''')


# 4 pillars of OOP

# Abstraction
print('''Abstraction is modelling the real world/ a concept that might be complex through attributes and methods \n thus exposing relevant information and actions while hiding the complexity\n\n''')

# Encapsulation
print('Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit.\nIt is the restriction of access of certain methods or information\n\n')

# Inheritance
print('Inheritance is when a class uses code constructed within another class.\n\n')

# Polymorphism
print('Polymorphism describes the ability to redefine/overide methods.\nOnly happens after inheritance. Same method, but behaves in different ways.')
